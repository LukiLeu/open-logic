## Description

This entity implements a weighted round-robin arbiter. Each input in the _In\_Req_ vector is assigned a configurable
weight via the _Weights_ vector. The weight specifies how many identical grants on the _Out\_Grant_ vector can be
issued consecutively before the arbiter moves to the next grant.

When _In\_Valid_ is asserted, the arbiter checks active requests and produces a grant.

- If _Latency\_g = 0_: _Out\_Valid_ is asserted in the same clock cycle.
- If _Latency\_g = 1_: _Out\_Valid_ is asserted one clock cycle later. In return this option can run at
  higher clock frequencies.

_Out\_Valid_ indicates that _Out\_Grant_ holds a valid result. _Out\_Grant_ may be one-hot or all-zero
if no grant is possible, such as when all weights are zero, there are no active requests or a combination of both.

### Example

The following waveforms show scenarios with No _Latency_g=0_ and with _Latency_g=1_, highlighting signal behavior
in each case. Note that for all figures, _WeightWidth_g=4_ is assumed, so every weight maps
to a single hex-digit, which is easy to read.

![Example-Waveform](./arb/olo_base_arb_wrr_into.png)

In the first cycle, the first requester gets a grant.

In the second cycle the grant is switched to the next entitled requester because the _Weights_ for the
first requester is only 1 and it already got that one grant. The second requester did not request a grant
(_In_Req_='0').

Hence the third requester gets the grant for two cycles (becaust the corresponding _Weight_ is 2).

In the last cycle, the last requester gets the grant. The second last requester does _not_ get a grant
although _In_Req='1'_ because the corresponding _Weight_ is zero.

### Important Note on Input Timing

_Weights_ is treated as a static control signal. Changes are reflected in the behavior of the arbiter within less than
5 clock cycles or one input sample.

Normally this does not play a role becaus _Weights_ in most applications is static. However, if _Weights_
changes dynamically this must be kept in mind.

This is an implementation tradeoff chosen to limit the lenght of combinatorial paths (i.e. to allow
higher clock frequencies).

Changes in _In_Req_ are applied immediately.
